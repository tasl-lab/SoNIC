# SoNIC
This repository will share the codebase and pretrained models for the paper _SoNIC: Safe Social Navigation with Adaptive Conformal Inference and Constrained Reinforcement Learning_. The project website is [https://sonic-social-nav.github.io/](https://sonic-social-nav.github.io/).

Please try our testing and visualization code at [this zip file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WAwihUR_T3HY44rO6cSdz_zgJC4AOG1L/view?usp=sharing). We will release the training scripts after the paper is formally published. Thank you for your attention!
